## 🏗️ Architecture

This project uses a **feature-based architecture** with strict separation between features and a shared UI/component library.

### Key Principles
- **Feature Isolation:** Each feature is self-contained and independent
- **Shared Components Are Pure:** No business logic in shared components
- **HOCs for Feature Logic:** Use Higher-Order Components to add feature-specific behavior

### Folder Structure
```
features/
  ├── courses/          # Course management feature
  ├── admin/            # Admin panel feature
  └── auth/             # Authentication feature
shared/
  ├── components/       # Reusable UI components
  ├── hooks/           # Shared custom hooks
  └── utils/           # Utility functions
```
